# nvn v01 - exploring the resilience of railway networks in German cities

This coding project aims at identifying the local railway transportation networks in German cities that are most vulnerable to punctual stress. The project is entirely motivated by curiosity and a tiny bit of grief about being late to work.

The project is available as RMarkdown-notebook (.Rmd). It is a bit tricky to get these displayed properly on github. It can be viewed as .html by clicking this link:

The data on the railway networks are collected manually and will be completed in the future. This is a functional first release with a still incomplete data basis and preliminary findings.
