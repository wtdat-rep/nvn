# nvn v01 - exploring the resilience of German cities railway networks

This coding project aims at identifying the local railway transportation networks in German cities that are most vulnurable to punctual stress. The project is entirely motivated by curiosity and a tiny bit of grief about being late to work.

The project is available as RMarkdown-notebook.

The data on the railway networks are collected manually and will be expanded in the future. This is a functional first release with a still incomplete data basis and preliminary findings.
